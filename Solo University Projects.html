            <p>
                For the final year of my undergraduate course, Computing for Games at Falmouth University, I am writing my dissertation about the context steering 
                framework and developing an artefact that involves an AI agent with context steering to navigate a randomised dungeon map and collect targets around the 
                map whilst avoiding obstacles. The context steering framework is one that allows different types of AI behaviours to merged into one agent whilst smoothing 
                the agent's movement, improve the decision making during run-time, and maintaining steady frame rates.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the artefact, the features I have developed are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A modification of a procedural map generator to allow for entities to be spawned</li>
                    <li>Target Selection for the context steering agent</li>
                    <li>Collision Tracking</li>
                    <li>Data Management system that stores the parameters and variables required for my experiment into an CSV file</li>
                    <li>Game Manager that allows for the simulations of my experiment running to be automated and stored</li>
                </ul><br>
                Other skills I have developed during the dissertation is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing unit tests</li>
                    <li>Agile practices in purely a software engineering context</li>
                    <li>Using Python/R code to analyse data</li>
                    <li>Performing statistics tests</li>
                    <li>Writing in a research context</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Aurora Lights Graphics Simulation</h3>

                This 3rd year module of the university course required us to create a graphics simulation of our choice and follow the graphics pipeline to develop it including adding 
                improvements and optimizing the artefact. For my artefact, I chose to do a simulation of the Aurora Lights in OpengGL using a particle system and Kernel blurring. As 
                part of this module, I learnt how to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Draw shapes, textures and meshes onto a screen</li>
                    <li>Set up a camera system to navigate a scene</li>
                    <li>Write shaders using OpenGL's shader language</li>
                    <li>Transform objects during run-time</li>
                    <li>Set up a particle system in OpenGL</li>
                    <li>Use a blurring technique in shader language</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Boss fight prototype in Unreal Engine 5</h3>
        <div class="small">

                Project Duration: September 2023 - January 2024<br>
                Engine and Tools: Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of a second year module at university, our assignment required us to 
                recreate a boss fight from an existing game of our choice. The assigment also 
                required us to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a playable game loop</li>
                    <li>Use Unreal Engine 5 and program some functionality in the prototype
                         using C++</li>
                    <li>Use the AI behaviour tree system for our boss</li>
                    <li>Optimise our game using the tools provided by Unreal Engine 5</li>
                    <li>Create a poster presenting how we have optimised our prototypes</li>
                </ul><br>
                For my prototype, I recreated aspects of the first boss fight from the game, 
                "Kirby and the Forgotten Land" by Nintendo, Gorimondo. I chose this boss fight 
                to recreate because I had recently completed the game at that point and it was 
                a simple yet interesting first boss fight. As part of the prototype of my 
                assignment, I had to:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closely recreate the player's inhale and exhale mechanic from Kirby 
                        (done in C++)</li>
                    <li>Spawn 'stars' around the map for the player to inhale and spit at the 
                        boss (majorly done in Blueprints)</li>
                    <li>Implement AI behaviour for the boss to closely imitate the attacks from 
                        Gorimondo (done in Blueprints and in-engine Behaviour Tree)</li>
                    <li>Implement main menu and HUD for displaying healthbars (done in Blueprints)</li>
                </ul><br>
