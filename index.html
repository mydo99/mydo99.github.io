        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="small">
            <p>
                I'm a hardworking, passionate Computing for Games (BSc) student at Falmouth
                 University who has recently completed my third year of the course. I am
                 currently honing my skills as a games programmer to provide engaging and 
                polished gameplay for the next generation of games.
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up I've loved playing games, from the Nintendo titles like the Mario 
                and Kirby franchises to the indie successes like Hollow Knight and Stardew 
                Valley. I was always fond of how each game immerses me as the player into a 
            unique, captivating world and I wish to create unforgettable, exciting experiences
            through game development.

        <h4>Boss fight prototype in Unreal Engine 5</h4>
        <div class="small">
            <p>
                As part of a second year module at university, our assignment required us to 
                recreate a boss fight from an existing game of our choice. The assigment also 
                required us to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a playable game loop</li>
                    <li>Use Unreal Engine 5 and program some functionality in the prototype
                         using C++</li>
                    <li>Use the AI behaviour tree system for our boss</li>
                    <li>Optimise our game using the tools provided by Unreal Engine 5</li>
                    <li>Create a poster presenting how we have optimised our prototypes</li>
                </ul><br>
                For my prototype, I recreated aspects of the first boss fight from the game, 
                "Kirby and the Forgotten Land" by Nintendo, Gorimondo. I chose this boss fight 
                to recreate because I had recently completed the game at that point and it was 
                a simple yet interesting first boss fight. As part of the prototype of my 
                assignment, I had to:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Closely recreate the player's inhale and exhale mechanic from Kirby 
                        (done in C++)</li>
                    <li>Spawn 'stars' around the map for the player to inhale and spit at the 
                        boss (majorly done in Blueprints)</li>
                    <li>Implement AI behaviour for the boss to closely imitate the attacks from 
                        Gorimondo (done in Blueprints and in-engine Behaviour Tree)</li>
                    <li>Implement main menu and HUD for displaying healthbars (done in Blueprints)</li>
                </ul><br>

        <h4>Diplomatic Emunity by The Emu Agenda</h4>
        <div class="small">
            <p>
                For the team project of the first year of my university course, our team, The Emu 
                Agenda, created a tower defense game based on The Great Emu War in Australia. 
                In Diplomatic Emunity, the player runs around the wastelands of Australia to 
                place down towers whilst fighting back with their gun to defend against a 
                variety of emus. <br><br>

                This game was developed in Unity and was therefore programmed in C#. There was 
                also a few constraints for this project in particular as our team was composed 
                of solely programmers and our game had to be based on an event in history. As a 
                programmer, I worked on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Player movement and shooting</li>
                    <li>Implementing some types of towers</li>
                    <li>AI Boss behaviour</li>
                    <li>UI elements including health bars and pause menu</li>
                    <li>Currency system</li>
                </ul><br>
                I also took the initiative to work on other aspects of the game outside of 
                programming including:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tower Art</li>
                    <li>Player character art</li>
                    <li>Music during the main gameplay</li>
                    <li>Stat changes with tower types and enemies</li>
                </ul><br>
