                For the team project of the first year of my university course, our team, The Emu 
                Agenda, created a tower defense game based on The Great Emu War in Australia. 
                In Diplomatic Emunity, the player runs around the wastelands of Australia to 
                place down towers whilst fighting back with their gun to defend against a 
                variety of emus. <br><br>

                This game was developed in Unity and was therefore programmed in C#. There was 
                also a few constraints for this project in particular as our team was composed 
                of solely programmers and our game had to be based on an event in history. As a 
                programmer, I worked on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Player movement and shooting</li>
                    <li>Implementing some types of towers</li>
                    <li>AI Boss behaviour</li>
                    <li>UI elements including health bars and pause menu</li>
                    <li>Currency system</li>
                </ul><br>
                I also took the initiative to work on other aspects of the game outside of 
                programming including:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tower Art</li>
                    <li>Player character art</li>
                    <li>Music during the main gameplay</li>
                    <li>Stat changes with tower types and enemies</li>
                </ul><br>
